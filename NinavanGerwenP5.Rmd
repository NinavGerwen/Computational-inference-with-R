# Exercise A: Storms

To start, load the tidyverse package and the correct dataset:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data <- data(storms)
```

A.1:
```{r}
# To find all storms that occured in june: filter the data set for which the month is 6 
filter(data, month == 6)

# Repeat for storms that occured in april (month == 4) OR (|) may (month == 5)
filter(data, month == 4 | month == 5)

# To find the storms that occured on a specific day: specify the month AND (&) the day
filter(data, month == 5 & day == 30)

# To find the storms between may 1st and 15th, specify month == 5 and day within (%in%) 1:15
filter(data, month == 5 & day %in% c(1:15))
```

A.2:
```{r}
# Arrange the dataset storms by year, months and day (in this order)
arrange(data, year, month, day)
```

A.3:
```{r}
# Arrange (same as sort) the dataset storm by ascending pressure and then by ascending latitude
arrange(data, pressure, lat)
```

A.4:
```{r}
# S
select(data, year:hour)

select(data, !year:hour)
```

A.5:
```{r}
relocate(data, name, category, wind)
```

A.6:
```{r}
# When selecting a variable name once:
select(data, wind)
# When selecting a variable name multiple times:
select(data, wind, wind, wind)
```
As you can see, nothing happens when you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call. It simply ignores the repetition.

A.7:
```{r}
select(data, year:day, wind, ends_with("diameter"))
```


# Exercise B: Diamonds

To start, load the correct package and dataset:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

data(diamonds)
```

B.1:
```{r}
diamonds %>% mutate()

```
